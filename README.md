Open Toledo is a group of volunteers that contribute our talents toward improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. This group is inspired by Code For America, which you can learn more about here: https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government?language=en
We plan on having both in-person meetups as well as online collaboration. Open Toledo is for anybody who wants to:
Get work done on civic projects
Start a new project, or find one to join (all backgrounds welcome!)
Bounce ideas and get help from tech and gov experts
Learn about open data, smart cities, and open government
