<p>We plan on having both in-person meetups as well as online collaboration. Open Toledo is for anybody who wants to:

<ul>
	<li>Get work done on civic projects
	<li>Start a new project, or find one to join (all backgrounds welcome!)
	<li>Bounce ideas and get help from tech and gov experts
	<li>Learn about open data, smart cities, and open government
</li>
